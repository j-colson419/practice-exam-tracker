Information to store:
	Question
		- the actual question content (long text or text area)
		- topic and subtopic (to be able to determine which questions to use in a quiz/interview
			-- this would be as opposed to weeks, since the curriculum can change so much
		- whether it's active or not 
			-- also because the curriculum changes so much
		+ possibly some key words to look for in an answer, but possibly not.
		- point value
			-- for one on ones, to be able to score out of a certain amount
		+ possibly some accepted answer examples.
			-- this can help with QC, but also can help others understand what the question is looking for, if unclear.
	
	Interview
		- to represent an instance of an assessment. (whether it be QC or One-on-One)
			++ possibly have a record type for QC vs One-on-One but maybe not, that is kinda out of scope right now
		- Date
		- associate
		- trainer/question asker
		- Topics covered
			-- maybe autopopulated via code based on the questions selected? Or the other way around
			maybe questions are selected based on these selected topics. 
		- overall score
	
	Notes
		- can be related to a particular question
		+ record type for verbal vs technical?
		- junction object between interview and question.
		- long text to store the actual note
		- score to track the score for the particular question or just a verbal evaluation score.
			-- this would be used to calculate the overall score on the interview
